# WPackIO Repro

## Setup

This is a standard child theme which can be added to any WordPress installation. And WPackIO is initialized the standard way.

A few commands needs to be run in order to set everything up:

```sh
// First install all js dependencies
yarn
// or
npm install

// Then install php dependencies
composer install

// Finally build production files
yarn build
// or
npm build
```

## Issue

I have an issue where my built files complain about `regeneratorRuntime` gone
missing.

```js
Uncaught ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
    at Object.<anonymous> (app.js:1)
    at i (bootstrap:78)
    at Object.<anonymous> (main-c1ba787b.js?ver=1.0.0:18)
    at i (bootstrap:78)
    at t (bootstrap:45)
    at Array.r [as push] (bootstrap:32)
    at main-c1ba787b.js?ver=1.0.0:18
```

The strange this though is that the error only gets thrown on the front end, not on the admin pages. I suspect that this has something to do with WordPress using babel while building there js and therefore `regeneratorRuntime` is already injected.

## Solution

It's not an uncommon issue in the world of transpiled JavaScript. But the solution is quite simple:

```js
const babelConfig = {
  // ...other configs,
  plugins: [
    // ...other plugins,
    '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime',
  ],
};
```

But while investigating this issue I found another issue as well â€“ the `jsBabelPresetOptions` and `jsBabelOverride` props inside `wpackio.project.js` never gets applied. Therefore the only way to add the new plugin to an existing project is to create my own `babel.config.js` and apply it there.

I would argue that WPackIO should add `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` by default, much like [`create-react-app` does](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/4b8b38bf7c55326f8d51ea9deeea76d7feee307d/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L169).
